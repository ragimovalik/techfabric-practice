### Task

Requirements:

1. The game should have a registration form that collects the user's name and
   email address. The form should include basic validation to ensure that both
   fields are not empty and correct email input.
2. The game should have 5 levels, and the player should be able to progress to
   the next level by reaching a target number of clicks for each level.
3. Each level should have a different enemy (or even theme).
4. The game should keep track of the player's score, which is the total number
   of clicks they have made across all levels. The score should be displayed on
   the screen at all times.
5. The game should have a button that the player can click to earn points. Each
   click should add one point to the player's score.
6. When the player reaches the target number of clicks for a level, a message
   should be displayed on the screen congratulating them on reaching the next
   level.
7. The game should be hosted on GitHub so that other people can play it and
   review your code.
